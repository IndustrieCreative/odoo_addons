    <title>M2M and M2O orphan Attachments garbage collector</title>
</head>

<body>
    <p>
        This module periodically deletes all orphaned attachments after the relationship with a given model has been broken due to either deletion of the record or modification of the field pointing to the attachment.
    </p>
    <p>
        The garbage collector is only activated on models where there is an attribute <code>_attachment_garbage_collector</code> set to <code>True</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>WARNING</b>: It only handles Many2any and Many2one fields pointing to "ir.attachment" and with domain <code>[('res_model', '=', _name)]</code>.
    </p>
